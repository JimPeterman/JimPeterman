### A little about me:
I am a data scientist and researcher. I have a background in physiology but love digging into data to explore answers to all kinds of questions, especially those questions related to health and well-being.

I have managed and utilized data from well-established databases, including the BALL ST cohort as well as the [FRIEND database](https://share.streamlit.io/jimpeterman/friend_app/main/app.py), to examine how to best assess fitness and how these assessments can predict health outcomes. I have published findings from this research in peer-reviewed scientific journals (>35 publications).

I am also a cofounder and the Chief Science Officer for [Fuelfood](https://www.fuelfood.io/) - an app designed to improve meal planning for athletes.
