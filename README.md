### A little about me:
I am a data scientist and researcher. I have a background in physiology but love using data to answer all kinds of questions.

As a researcher, I primarily utilize data from the BALL ST cohort as well as the [FRIEND database](https://share.streamlit.io/jimpeterman/friend_app/main/app.py) to explore how to assess fitness and how these assessments can predict health outcomes.

I am also a cofounder and the Chief Science Officer for [Fuelfood](https://www.fuelfood.io/) - an app designed to improve meal planning for athletes.
